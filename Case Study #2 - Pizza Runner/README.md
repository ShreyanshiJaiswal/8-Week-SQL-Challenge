## Business Task

This case study focuses on helping Danny improve operations for his startup, Pizza Runner. Using data from the pizza_runner schema, the goal is to clean the raw datasets and perform basic analysis to support better decision-making around deliveries and orders. The tables involved in this case study include: runners, customer_orders, runner_orders, pizza_names, pizza_recipes, pizza_toppings, and members. All SQL queries should reference the pizza_runner schema.

## Data Cleaning & Transformation

### Table: customer_orders

Looking at the **customer_orders** table, we can see there are:  
- The `exclusions` column has missing, blank, or `'null'` values.
- The `extras` column has missing, blank, or `'null'` values.
  
| order_id | customer_id | pizza_id | exclusions | extras | order_time          |
| -------- | ----------- | -------- | ---------- | ------ | ------------------- |
| 1        | 101         | 1        |            |        | 2020-01-01 18:05:02 |

**Our work now:**  
Replace all `NULL`, `'null'`, or blank entries in `exclusions` and `extras` columns with a blank space `' '`.  
Create a temporary table with all the columns using this cleaned data.
```sql
CREATE TEMP TABLE customer_orders_temp AS
SELECT 
  order_id, 
  customer_id, 
  pizza_id, 
  CASE
	  WHEN exclusions IS null OR exclusions LIKE 'null' THEN ' '
	  ELSE exclusions
	  END AS exclusions,
  CASE
	  WHEN extras IS NULL or extras LIKE 'null' THEN ' '
	  ELSE extras
	  END AS extras,
	order_time
FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders;
```
This is how the clean customer_orders_temp table looks like and we will use this table to run all our queries.
