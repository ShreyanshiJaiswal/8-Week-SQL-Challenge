## Business Task

In this case study, I'm helping Danny analyze customer data to understand their visit patterns, spending habits, and favorite menu items. Iâ€™ll use SQL to answer his business questions using the `sales`, `menu`, and `members` datasets.

## Question and Solution

Iâ€™ve solved the following question on [DB Fiddle](https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/2rM8RAnq7h5LLDTzZiRWcd/138) ðŸ’»

**1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?**
```sql
SELECT 
  sales.customer_id, 
  SUM(menu.price) AS total_sales
FROM dannys_diner.sales
INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu
  ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
GROUP BY sales.customer_id
ORDER BY sales.customer_id ASC;
```
**Output:**
| customer\_id | total\_sales |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| A            | 76           |
| B            | 74           |
| C            | 36           |

**2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?**
```sql
SELECT 
  customer_id, 
  COUNT(DISTINCT order_date) AS visit_count
FROM dannys_diner.sales
GROUP BY customer_id;
```
**Output:**
| customer_id | visit_count |
|-------------|-------------|
| A           | 4           |
| B           | 6           |
| C           | 2           |

**3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?**
```sql
SELECT 
  s.customer_id, 
  s.order_date, 
  m.product_name
FROM dannys_diner.sales AS s
JOIN dannys_diner.menu AS m 
  ON s.product_id = m.product_id
WHERE s.order_date = (
  SELECT MIN(order_date)
  FROM dannys_diner.sales AS inner_s
  WHERE inner_s.customer_id = s.customer_id
)
ORDER BY s.customer_id;
```
**Output:**
| customer_id | order_date | product_name |
|-------------|------------|--------------|
| A           | 2021-01-01 | sushi        |
| A           | 2021-01-01 | curry        |
| B           | 2021-01-01 | curry        |
| C           | 2021-01-01 | ramen        |

**4. Find the most purchased item on the menu and how many times it was purchased?**
```sql
SELECT 
  menu.product_name, 
  COUNT(*) AS frequency
FROM dannys_diner.sales
JOIN dannys_diner.menu 
  ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
GROUP BY menu.product_name
ORDER BY frequency DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
**Output:**
| product_name | frequency |
|--------------|-----------|
| ramen        | 8         |

**5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?**
```sql
WITH ranked_orders AS (
  SELECT 
    s.customer_id,
    m.product_name,
    COUNT(*) AS order_count,
    RANK() OVER (
      PARTITION BY s.customer_id 
      ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
    ) AS rank
  FROM sales s
  JOIN menu m ON s.product_id = m.product_id
  GROUP BY s.customer_id, m.product_name
)

SELECT customer_id, product_name, order_count
FROM ranked_orders
WHERE rank = 1;
```
**Output:**
| customer\_id | product\_name | order\_count |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------ |
| A            | Curry         | 2            |
| B            | Sushi         | 2            |
| C            | Ramen         | 3            |
