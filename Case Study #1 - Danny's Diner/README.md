## Business Task

In this case study, I'm helping Danny analyze customer data to understand their visit patterns, spending habits, and favorite menu items. Iâ€™ll use SQL to answer his business questions using the `sales`, `menu`, and `members` datasets.

**1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?**

```sql
SELECT 
  sales.customer_id, 
  SUM(menu.price) AS total_sales
FROM dannys_diner.sales
INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu
  ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
GROUP BY sales.customer_id
ORDER BY sales.customer_id ASC;` ``` `

| customer\_id | total\_sales |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| A            | 76           |
| B            | 74           |
| C            | 36           |
