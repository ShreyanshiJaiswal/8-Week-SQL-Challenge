## Business Task

In this case study, I'm helping Danny analyze customer data to understand their visit patterns, spending habits, and favorite menu items. Iâ€™ll use SQL to answer his business questions using the `sales`, `menu`, and `members` datasets.

## Question and Solution

Iâ€™ve solved the following question on [DB Fiddle](https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/2rM8RAnq7h5LLDTzZiRWcd/138) ðŸ’»

**1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?**
```sql
SELECT 
  sales.customer_id, 
  SUM(menu.price) AS total_sales
FROM dannys_diner.sales
INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu
  ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
GROUP BY sales.customer_id
ORDER BY sales.customer_id ASC;
```
**Output:**
| customer\_id | total\_sales |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| A            | 76           |
| B            | 74           |
| C            | 36           |

**2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?**
```sql
SELECT 
  customer_id, 
  COUNT(DISTINCT order_date) AS visit_count
FROM dannys_diner.sales
GROUP BY customer_id;
```
**Output:**
| customer_id | visit_count |
|-------------|-------------|
| A           | 4           |
| B           | 6           |
| C           | 2           |

**3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?**
```sql
SELECT 
  s.customer_id, 
  s.order_date, 
  m.product_name
FROM dannys_diner.sales AS s
JOIN dannys_diner.menu AS m 
  ON s.product_id = m.product_id
WHERE s.order_date = (
  SELECT MIN(order_date)
  FROM dannys_diner.sales AS inner_s
  WHERE inner_s.customer_id = s.customer_id
)
ORDER BY s.customer_id;
```
**Output:**
| customer_id | order_date | product_name |
|-------------|------------|--------------|
| A           | 2021-01-01 | sushi        |
| A           | 2021-01-01 | curry        |
| B           | 2021-01-01 | curry        |
| C           | 2021-01-01 | ramen        |

**4. Find the most purchased item on the menu and how many times it was purchased?**
```sql
SELECT 
  menu.product_name, 
  COUNT(*) AS frequency
FROM dannys_diner.sales
JOIN dannys_diner.menu 
  ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
GROUP BY menu.product_name
ORDER BY frequency DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
**Output:**
| product_name | frequency |
|--------------|-----------|
| ramen        | 8         |

**5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?**
```sql
WITH ranked_orders AS (
  SELECT 
    dannys_diner.sales.customer_id,
    dannys_diner.menu.product_name,
    COUNT(*) AS order_count,
    RANK() OVER (
      PARTITION BY dannys_diner.sales.customer_id 
      ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
    ) AS rank
  FROM dannys_diner.sales
  JOIN dannys_diner.menu ON dannys_diner.sales.product_id = dannys_diner.menu.product_id
  GROUP BY dannys_diner.sales.customer_id, dannys_diner.menu.product_name
)

SELECT customer_id, product_name, order_count
FROM ranked_orders
WHERE rank = 1;

```
**Output:**
| customer\_id | product\_name | order\_count |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------ |
| A            | Curry         | 2            |
| B            | Sushi         | 2            |
| C            | Ramen         | 3            |

**6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?**
```sql
WITH joined_as_member AS (
  SELECT
    members.customer_id, 
    sales.product_id,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
      PARTITION BY members.customer_id
      ORDER BY sales.order_date) AS row_num
  FROM dannys_diner.members
  INNER JOIN dannys_diner.sales
    ON members.customer_id = sales.customer_id
    AND sales.order_date > members.join_date
)

SELECT 
  customer_id, 
  product_name 
FROM joined_as_member
INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu
  ON joined_as_member.product_id = menu.product_id
WHERE row_num = 1
ORDER BY customer_id ASC;
```
**Output**
| customer_id | product_name |
|-------------|--------------|
| A           | curry        |
| B           | sushi        |

**7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?**
```sql
WITH purchased_prior_member AS (
  SELECT 
    members.customer_id, 
    sales.product_id,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
      PARTITION BY members.customer_id
      ORDER BY sales.order_date DESC) AS rank
  FROM dannys_diner.members
  INNER JOIN dannys_diner.sales
    ON members.customer_id = sales.customer_id
    AND sales.order_date < members.join_date
)

SELECT 
  p_member.customer_id, 
  menu.product_name 
FROM purchased_prior_member AS p_member
INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu
  ON p_member.product_id = menu.product_id
WHERE rank = 1
ORDER BY p_member.customer_id ASC;
```
**Output**
| customer_id | product_name |
|-------------|--------------|
| A           | sushi        |
| B           | sushi        |

**8. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?**
```sql
SELECT 
  sales.customer_id, 
  COUNT(sales.product_id) AS total_items, 
  SUM(menu.price) AS total_sales
FROM dannys_diner.sales
INNER JOIN dannys_diner.members
  ON sales.customer_id = members.customer_id
  AND sales.order_date < members.join_date
INNER JOIN dannys_diner.menu
  ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
GROUP BY sales.customer_id
ORDER BY sales.customer_id;
```
**Output**
| customer_id | total_items | total_sales |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| A           | 2           | 25          |
| B           | 3           | 40          |

**9. If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?**
```sql
WITH points_cte AS (
  SELECT 
    menu.product_id, 
    CASE
      WHEN product_id = 1 THEN price * 20
      ELSE price * 10 
    END AS points
  FROM dannys_diner.menu
)

SELECT 
  sales.customer_id, 
  SUM(points_cte.points) AS total_points
FROM dannys_diner.sales
INNER JOIN points_cte
  ON sales.product_id = points_cte.product_id
GROUP BY sales.customer_id
ORDER BY sales.customer_id;
```
**Output**
| customer_id | total_points |
|-------------|--------------|
| A           | 760          |
| B           | 740          |
| C           | 360          |

**10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?**
```sql
SELECT 
  sales.customer_id,
  SUM(
    CASE 
      WHEN sales.order_date BETWEEN members.join_date AND DATE_ADD(members.join_date, INTERVAL 6 DAY) THEN menu.price * 10 * 2
      ELSE menu.price * 10
    END
  ) AS total_points
FROM dannys_diner.sales
JOIN dannys_diner.menu
  ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
JOIN dannys_diner.members
  ON sales.customer_id = members.customer_id
WHERE sales.customer_id IN ('A', 'B')
  AND sales.order_date <= '2021-01-31'
GROUP BY sales.customer_id
ORDER BY sales.customer_id;
```
**Output**
| customer_id | total_points |
|-------------|--------------|
| A           | 450          |
| B           | 500          |
