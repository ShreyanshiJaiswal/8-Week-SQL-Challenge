## Business Task

Danny wants to use the data to answer questions about his customers, including their visiting patterns, spending habits, and favourite menu items. These insights will help him offer a more personalised experience and decide whether to expand the customer loyalty program.

Due to privacy, Danny provided a sample of his overall customer data. Your task is to write SQL queries based on three key datasets: `sales`, `menu`, and `members`, to answer his questions and generate easy-to-inspect datasets for his team.
