# 8-Week SQL Challenge

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my **8-Week SQL Challenge** repository.  
Here, I'll be solving 8 interesting SQL case studies by **Data with Danny** over the course of 8 weeks.

The goal is to improve my SQL skills by practicing real-world problems, one case study at a time.

There are 8 case studies in this challenge:

- Case Study #1 - Danny's Diner  
- Case Study #2 - Pizza Runner  
- Case Study #3 - Foodie-Fi  
- Case Study #4 - Data Bank  
- Case Study #5 - Data Mart  
- Case Study #6 - Clique Bait
