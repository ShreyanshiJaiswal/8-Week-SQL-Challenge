# 8-Week SQL Challenge by Data With Danny

This repository contains my solutions to the **8-Week SQL Challenge** created by [Data With Danny](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/). The challenge includes 8 real-world business case studies, each designed to strengthen SQL and data analysis skills through practical scenarios.

As part of my learning journey, I’m using this challenge to deepen my understanding of SQL, improve my ability to work with relational databases, and gain hands-on experience solving data problems from different industries. Each case study helps reinforce key SQL concepts such as joins, aggregations, subqueries, CTEs, window functions, and data transformations.

## Purpose

I created this repository to:

- Improve and solidify my SQL querying skills  
- Practice analytical thinking using real-world data  
- Build a strong foundation in data analysis using SQL
